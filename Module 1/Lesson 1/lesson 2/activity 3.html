    <p>Hello! My name is <b>Rayyan Rabbani</b> and this is my first project of html. Im still new to this. But it is
        very fun! Im enjoying it so far and when I know all the basics, I will try to do some more <b>activities</b> and
        use my <b>creativity.</b>
        I hope I get to <b>master</b> <b>the basics of html,</b> so I can go and make more interresting stuff by
        <b>myself.</b></p>
    <br>
    Thanks for listening to what I had to say, I hope I can achieve my dream to do <b>HTML</b> like a pro.
    <br>
    Yours Truly,
    <br>
    Rayyan.
